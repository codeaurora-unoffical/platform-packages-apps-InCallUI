    <!-- The main content of the CallCard is either one or two "call info"
         blocks, depending on whether one or two lines are in use.

         The call_info blocks are stacked vertically inside a CallCard (LinearLayout),
         each with layout_weight="1".  If only one line is in use (i.e. the
         common case) then the 2nd call info will be GONE and thus the 1st one
         will expand to fill the full height of the CallCard. -->


    <!-- Primary "call card" block, for the foreground call. -->
    <include android:id="@+id/primary_call_info"
            layout="@layout/rcs_primary_call_info" />
